## L0phtCrack for beginners

L0phtCrack is a password auditing tool that can attempt to crack all the passwords on your machine and gives you
 a report with which accounts have insecure passwords.

## Purpose of L0phtCrack
L0phtCrack is a password auditing tool, it can show you which accounts have passwords vulnerable to brute force or
 dictionary attacks with other tools like Ophcrack or John The Ripper. You are attacking your own accounts 
and making changes before an attacker gets the chance to.

L0phtCrack is a great way to test the passwords on your system, as it does the same attacks a normal password
Cracking software would do. This lets you know if your passwords can be cracked easily, before someone else 
Cracks your weak passwords.
