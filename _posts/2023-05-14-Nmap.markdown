## Nmap for beginners
----
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful and widely-used open-source network scanner tool. It was initially developed and released in 1997 by Gordon Lyon (Fyodor). The Nmap tool runs on the command line/terminal, but there is a GUI version of the tool as well, called Zenmap. Using Nmap we can scan entire networks or single hosts to monitor them or gather information about them. An Nmap scan will tell us:
  - what hosts are available on the network, 
  - what services those hosts offer (application name and version), 
  - what operating systems (and OS versions) are running, 
  - what packet filters/firewalls are used, and other details.

With Nmap we can perform:
  - Host Discovery: Nmap can identify active hosts on a network.
  - Port Scanning: It can scan open ports to identify running services.
  - OS Fingerprinting: Nmap can guess the operating system running on a target host.
  - Service and Version Detection: Nmap can determine the specific software versions running on services.
  - Vulnerability Scanning: We can also use Nmap to detect vulnerabilities on the hosts. With NSE (Nmap Script Engine) we can use existing scripts or create new scripts to automate tasks and extent Nmapâ€™s functionality
