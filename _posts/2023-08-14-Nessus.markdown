## Nessus for beginners
- Nessus was created by Renaud Deraison in 1998
It offers a remote security scanner to the online community
- It examines a computer and alerts you if it finds any vulnerabilities that may be exploited by malevolent hackers to access any machine you have linked to a network
- It accomplishes this by doing more than 1200 tests on particular computers, checking to determine whether any of these threats may be used to infiltrate the computer or cause harm in other ways
- It works with several operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac
- It installs, scans, and reports numerous vulnerabilities via a web interface

## Why Nessus?
Nessus has many advantages over other network vulnerability scanners. The key points are included as follows:
- Unlike other scanners, Nessus does not make assumptions about your server configuration (such as assuming that port 80 must be the only web server) that can cause other scanners to miss real vulnerabilities.
- Nessus is very extensible, providing a scripting language for you to write tests specific to your system once you become more familiar with the tool. Its also provides a plug-in interface, and many free plug-ins are available from the [Nessus plug-in site](https://www.tenable.com/plugins).   These plugs are often specific to detecting a common virus or vulnerability. 
- Up to date information about new vulnerabilities and attacks.  The Nessus team updates the list of what vulnerabilities to check for on a daily basis in order to minimize the window between an exploit appearing in the wild, and you being able to detect it with Nessus.
- Open-source.  Nessus is open source, meaning it costs nothing, and you are free to see and modify the source as you wish.
- Patching Assistance:  When Nessus detects a vulnerability, it is also most often able to suggest the best way you can mitigate the vulnerability.
