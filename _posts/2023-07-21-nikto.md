Nikto comes preinstalled with Kali linux, so there is no install needed, kali is required to use Nikto. After opening Nikto, use the nikto –h “HOST” to start the scan, add –ssl to scan a website using HTTPS. In the HOST spot, you would put your target, which can be an IP address or a domain name. If you would like to export your results to a TXT file or HTML,  add –o to the end along with the file name
