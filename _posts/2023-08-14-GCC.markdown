## GCC for beginners

GCC is a powerful and widely-used compiler toolchain for multiple programming languages including C, C++, Ada, Fortran, Objective-C, and more. GCC stands for GNU Compiler Collection. It is an open-source compiler system developed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF)
GCC toolchain consists of several components:

 ## Purpose of GCC Tool

- Wide Language Support: GCC supports multiple programming languages, including C, C++, Ada, Fortran, Objective-C, and more. This versatility allows writing the code in different languages while using a consistent compiler toolchain.
- Portability: GCC is available for various platforms, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. This means developing code on one platform and compile it for execution on different target systems.
- Open-Source and Community Driven: GCC is an open-source project developed and maintained by the GNU Project and a large community of contributors. This means that the source code is freely available, and the user has the flexibility to modify and customize the compiler to suit specific needs.
- Performance and Optimization: GCC provides advanced optimization 
    techniques that can improve the performance of the programs, such as 
    loop unrolling, inline function expansion, and instruction scheduling, 
    to generate efficient machine code.
- Mature and Stable: GCC has been used for many years and has a long history of development and refinement. It is a mature and stable compiler that has been extensively tested and used in various production environments.
- Standards Compliance: GCC implements the relevant language standards, such as the C standard and the C++ standard, ensuring compatibility and portability of the code across different compilers and platforms.
- Robust Toolset: GCC provides a comprehensive set of tools beyond just the compiler, including the preprocessor, linker, assembler, and debugging/profiling utilities, which simplifies the development process and allows the user to perform tasks like code analysis, debugging, and optimization within a unified environment.
- Large User Community: GCC has a large and active user community, 
    which means that there is extensive documentation, tutorials, and support
    available online. 
## Uses of GCC
- Operating Systems: used to compile the kernel, device drivers, and other system components. 
Embedded Systems: can target a wide range of architectures, making it suitable for embedded platforms such as microcontrollers, IoT devices, and embedded Linux systems. 
- Application Development: supports programming languages like C, C++, Ada, and Fortran, making it versatile for different types of applications. 
High-Performance Computing: enables developers to write and optimize parallel code for supercomputers and HPC clusters. 
- Academic and Research Projects: commonly employed for teaching programming languages and compiler theory. 
- Open-Source Software: open-source nature aligns well with the philosophy of the open-source community. 
- Cross-Platform Development: able to target multiple platforms. Developers can write code on 
one platform and compile it for execution on different target systems, including Linux, macOS, 
Windows, and various embedded platforms.
## Requirements for Installation and Usage of GCC
- Compiler Executable - Translates source code into executable machine code
- Operating System - Linux, macOS, or Windows
- Development Libraries - Provide additional functionality and support for various language features (header files, import libraries, and runtime libraries)
- Text Editor/Source Code Editor -  Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, and Notepad++
- Build System/Makefile - Simplifies the compilation and linking process by automating repetitive tasks and managing project configurations
- Command-Line Interface (CLI) - GCC is primarily used through the command-line interface, where you issue commands to invoke the compiler and specify compilation options, source files, output files, and other parameters
- Debugging Tools (Optional) â€“ Troubleshoot and analyze code during development

## GCC Installation

#### For Windows
- Install msys64, a Windows port of GCC. Download it from the official website: [https://www.msys2.org/](https://www.msys2.org/) 
- Under installation section click on Download the installer:
 <img class="img-fluid" src="/EHEblog/images/GCC/2.png" alt="image showing download option of GCC">
- Run the installer and follow the instructions provided on the website. 
- Once the installation is complete, the MSYS terminal will show up on your screen. Follow the steps 6, 7 and 8 to verify if the GCC has being installed. Run the following commands:
  - `pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc`
  - `gcc --version`

If GCC is installed correctly, it will display the version information

#### For MacOS
- Install Xcode Command Line Tools by opening a terminal and running the following command:
    - `xcode-select --install`
 
 If GCC is installed correctly, it will display the version information

 #### For Linux
- Open a terminal.
- For Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu), run the following command:
    - `sudo apt-get update`
    - `sudo apt-get install build-essential`
- For Red Hat-based systems (e.g., Fedora), run the following command:
    - `sudo dnf update`
    - `sudo dnf group install "Development Tools"`

 If GCC is installed correctly, it will display the version information
