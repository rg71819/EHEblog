## Identify hashes with the hash-identifier tool
In order to crack a hash, it is first necessary to identify what type of hash it is. By knowing the type of hash, we are able to reduce the amount of time required to crack the hash. By using the hash-identifier tool, we can determine what Hash type is being used.
Hash-identifier tool with pre-installed in kali Linux. You can use it as follows
You can supply hash with the hash-identifier command as shown below.

Command: `hash-identifier <hash>`

Here is a screenshot showing possible types of hashes for the hash given with the command.

You can also access the hash-identifier tool by typing the hash-identifier command in the terminal and entering the hash when prompted. 

Command: `hash-identifier <hash>`

In the below screenshots you can see that when the hash is entered, possible types of hashes for the hash entered is shown.

## Password cracking with john the ripper
John the Ripper is a free password cracking software tool. The John Ripper tool can be used to crack hashes using wordlists. We can also extract password hashes from different file formats, such as zip, pdf, and documents, which can then be cracked.
To use john the ripper tool run john command. We can see the options available in john the ripper using the command below.
- Command: `john --help`

 <img class="img-fluid" src="/EHEblog/images/JohnTheRipper/0.0.png" alt="screenshot showing help menu of john the ripper">

To list the various types of hashes that john the ripper can crack/support. We can use the command below.
 - Command: `john --list=formats`
 
 <img class="img-fluid" src="/EHEblog/images/JohnTheRipper/0.1.png" alt="screenshot showing formats supported by JTR">  

## Cracking password hashes
To crack password hashes with john, we need the hashes that need to be cracked in a file and a wordlist and format of the hash.
Here we are using the rockyou.txt wordlist that is available in kali. Let’s extract the rockyou.txt wordlist using the command below.
- Command: `sudo gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rckyou.txt.gz`
 
 <img class="img-fluid" src="/EHEblog/images/JohnTheRipper/0.2.png" alt="screenshot showing the extraction of rockyou file">  

Now run the command below to crack the password hash available in the file named “hash”.
- Command: `john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash1 --format=raw-md5`
 
 <img class="img-fluid" src="/EHEblog/images/JohnTheRipper/0.3.png" alt="screenshot showing how to crack hash with JTR">  

Here is another example to crack the hash.
- Command: `john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash2 --format=raw-sha1`

## Cracking Zip file passwords
To crack the password of a zip file we need the password hash of that file, so let’s extract the hash from zip file using zip2john tool which is part of john the ripper tool suite and save it to a file
- Command: `zip2john test.zip > testZipHash`
 
 <img class="img-fluid" src="/EHEblog/images/JohnTheRipper/0.5.png" alt="screenshot showing how to extract hash from a zip file with JTR">   

 To see the contents of saved hash you can use the command below.
- Command: `cat testZipHash`

 <img class="img-fluid" src="/EHEblog/images/JohnTheRipper/0.6.png" alt="screenshot showing how to see the contents of saved hash file">

 To crack the password of zip file we need to use the extracted hash and a wordlist rockyou.txt as wordlist.
- Command: `john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt testZipHash`

 <img class="img-fluid" src="/EHEblog/images/JohnTheRipper/0.7.png" alt="screenshot showing how to crack the password of zip file using JTR">

after the password cracking is completed, we can still see the cracked password of a hash file using option `--show`.
- Command: `john --show testZipHash`

## Cracking ssh keys

To crack the password of a ssh private key we need the password hash of that key, so let’s extract the hash from private key using ssh2john tool which is part of john the ripper tool suite and save it to a file using the command below. 
- Command: `ssh2john id_rsa > sshHash`

 <img class="img-fluid" src="/EHEblog/images/JohnTheRipper/0.9.png" alt="screenshot showing how to crack the password of a ssh private key using JTR">

In the above step we had extracted the hash from private key now and displayed it, now let’s crack the extracted hash using a wordlist, we are using rockyou.txt as wordlist.
- Command: `john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt sshHash`

 <img class="img-fluid" src="/EHEblog/images/JohnTheRipper/0.10.png" alt="screenshot showing how to crack the password of a ssh private key using JTR">

## Crack passwords of word document
To crack the password of a word document we need the password hash of that word document. So, let’s extract the hash from a word document using the office2john tool. This is part of the john the ripper tool suite. We'll also save it to a file, using the command below.
- Command: `office2john Hello\ Hackerman.docx > officeHash`

 <img class="img-fluid" src="/EHEblog/images/JohnTheRipper/0.11.png" alt="screenshot showing how to crack the password of a word document using JTR">

 We can display the hash using the command below.
- Command: `cat officeHash`

 <img class="img-fluid" src="/EHEblog/images/JohnTheRipper/0.12.png" alt="screenshot showing how to crack the password of a word document using JTR">

 In the above step we had extracted the hash from private key now and displayed it, now let’s crack the extracted hash using a wordlist, we are using rockyou.txt as wordlist.
- Command: `john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt officeHash`
