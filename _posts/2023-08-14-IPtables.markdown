## IPTables for beginners
The most widely used firewall/NAT software for Linux was ipchains, however, it had a number of shortcomings. In order to address this, the Netfilter company chose to develop a new product called iptables and made the following improvements to it:
- Better integration with the Linux kernel, so improved speed and reliability.
- Stateful packet inspection.
- Filter packets according to TCP header and MAC address.
- Better network address translation.
- A rate limiting feature that helps iptables block some types of denial of service (DoS) attacks.

Considered a faster and more secure alternative to ipchains, iptables has become the default firewall package installed under RedHat and Fedora Linux.

There are three terminology are using for iptables: Tables, Chains, and Rules.

## Why do we need iptables?
There are many reasons for using iptables. For better understanding a list of reasons for using iptables are given below:
- It is a full feature tool providing with everything that may need
- It has flexibility to take any action with a packet
- It has a powerful software firewall
- It secures the system (PC) from unauthorized access.
- The Linux kernel firewall has the built-in ability to filter packets and allow outgoing and incoming network traffic into system (PC).

## Uses of Tool
The following operations can be done using iptables:

- Stateful (IPv4 only)/Stateless (IPv4 and IPv6 packet filtering
- Connection tracking
- All types of network address and port translation (NAT/NAPT)
- Use NAT and masquerading for sharing internet access if donâ€™t have enough public IP addresses.
- QoS (Quality of Service) routing
- Packet manipulation (mangling), such as altering the ToS (Type of Service) bits of the IP header.

## Requirements
The following facilities are required to use the tool (IPTables):

- Linux base operating system (Kali, Ubuntu, Pop OS, etc.)
- Package manager (apt, dnf, rpm, etc.)
- Any terminal
- Compressors to extract downloaded file (if use downloaded file)

## Installation Process

#### For Linux - Debian

Iptables comes pre-installed in most Linux distributions. However, the installation steps for Debian-based Linux distribution are as follows:
 1. Open terminal
 2. Type the following commands:
    - `sudo apt-get update`
    - `sudo apt install iptables`
 3. Once the IPTables installation completed, enable the firewall by the commands below:
    - `sudo systemctl enable iptables`
    - `sudo systemctl start iptables`
 4. To monitor the state of the IPTable service follow below command:
    - `sudo systemctl status iptables`

#### Linux - RHEL
Iptables comes pre-installed in most Linux distributions. However, the installation steps for RHEL-based Linux distribution are as follows:
 1. Open terminal
 2. Type the following commands:
    - `sudo dnf install iptables-services`
 3. Once the IPTables installation completed, enable the firewall by the commands below:
    - `sudo systemctl enable iptables`
    - `sudo systemctl start iptables`
 4. To monitor the state of the IPTable service follow below command:
    - `sudo systemctl status iptables`
